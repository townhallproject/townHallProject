# townHallProject

## Goals:
We are a volunteer-powered, grassroots effort that empowers constituents across the country to have face-to-face conversations with their elected representatives. We are campaign veterans and first time volunteers. We come from a diversity of backgrounds and live across the country. We share progressive values and believe strongly in civic engagement. We research every district and state for public events with Members of Congress. Then we share our findings far and wide to promote participation in the democratic process and make it as accessible as possible for everyone. We have a team of organizers that works with local groups on the ground to coordinate efforts and encourage citizens to amplify their voices.

The Town Hall Project offers our town hall event list to everyone, across the entire political spectrum. Our founders are dedicated to progressive values and actively encourage progressive allies to use our town hall data, but we are independent of any political party or organization.

This movement is diverse, open source, and powered by citizens. We are proud to be a part of it.

## Using our data:
The published event list on our site is open for citizens, activists, and researchers to use. We ask that those re-posting or re-publishing events attribute Town Hall Project and provide a link to townhallproject.com. Use of our REST API is available to partners on a case-by-case basis—to discuss please email info@townhallproject.com
